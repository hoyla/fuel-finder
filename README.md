# Fuel Finder historical tracking

Pulls snapshots from the [GOV.UK Fuel Finder API](https://www.developer.fuel-finder.service.gov.uk/) for UK fuel prices and station data, stores them in PostgreSQL, and optionally backs up raw JSON to S3.

Designed to build a **historical price database** from an API that only provides live snapshots. Every row in `fuel_prices` represents a genuine price change, enabling time-series analysis across ~7,500 UK fuel stations.

## Quick start (local)

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Fuel Finder API credentials ([register here](https://www.developer.fuel-finder.service.gov.uk/))

### 1. Configure credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your FUEL_API_ID and FUEL_API_SECRET
```

### 2. Run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL and runs a full scrape. The scraper container exits after completion; Postgres keeps running with the data.

### 3. Query the data

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U fuelfinder
```

```sql
-- Current prices (materialised view, includes canonical brand names + forecourt type)
SELECT brand_name, forecourt_type, city, postcode, fuel_type, price
FROM current_prices
WHERE fuel_type = 'E10'
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 20;

-- Average price by forecourt category
SELECT forecourt_type, ROUND(AVG(price), 1) AS avg_price, COUNT(*) AS stations
FROM current_prices
WHERE fuel_type = 'E10' AND NOT temporary_closure
GROUP BY forecourt_type
ORDER BY avg_price;

-- Price history for a station
SELECT fuel_type, price, observed_at
FROM fuel_prices
WHERE node_id = '<node_id>'
ORDER BY observed_at;
```

### 4. Run subsequent scrapes

```bash
# Auto mode: incremental if previous scrape exists, full otherwise
docker compose run --rm scraper python scrape.py auto

# Force a full scrape (re-fetches all stations + prices)
docker compose run --rm scraper python scrape.py full

# Incremental only (prices changed since last scrape)
docker compose run --rm scraper python scrape.py incremental
```

## API endpoints used

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/oauth/generate_access_token` | OAuth2 client credentials → bearer token (1h TTL) |
| `GET /api/v1/pfs/fuel-prices?batch-number=N` | Fuel prices, 500 stations/batch, 15 batches |
| `GET /api/v1/pfs/fuel-prices?batch-number=N&effective-start-timestamp=<ts>` | Incremental price updates since timestamp |
| `GET /api/v1/pfs?batch-number=N` | Station info (address, brand, amenities, opening times) |

## Scrape modes

| Mode | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `full` | Fetches all stations + all prices (15 batches each) | First run, daily refresh |
| `incremental` | Fetches only changed prices since last successful scrape | Regular polling (every 30 min) |
| `auto` | Incremental if a previous scrape exists, otherwise full | Default — set and forget |

## Key design decisions

- **Append-only prices**: `fuel_prices` only stores rows when the price has actually changed from the last stored value. This keeps storage lean and means every row is a genuine price change event.
- **Last-reported = current**: The `current_prices` materialised view treats the most recent observation as the current price, regardless of age. Stations that report infrequently are still included.
- **Raw data preserved**: Normalisation (brand cleanup) is done via lookup tables (`brand_aliases`, `station_brand_overrides`) that sit alongside the raw data. Original values are never modified.
- **Brand resolution**: `COALESCE(station_override, brand_alias, raw_brand_name)` — per-station overrides take priority, then bulk aliases, then the raw API value.
- **Regional grouping**: Postcode area prefixes are mapped to ONS-style regions (London, North West, Scotland, etc.) for regional comparisons. Seeded from `seed_postcode_regions.sql`.
- **Fuel type labels**: API codes like `B7_STANDARD` are mapped to human names like "Diesel" via the `fuel_type_labels` table. Seeded from `seed_fuel_types.sql`.
- **Anomaly detection**: On insert, prices are flagged (not filtered) if they fall outside 80–300p, look like decimal-place errors, or jump by more than 30%. Flags are stored in `anomaly_flags` on each `fuel_prices` row. See `queries/anomaly_detection.sql`.
- **Statistical outlier exclusion**: Dashboard averages and current-snapshot breakdowns exclude prices that fall outside the Tukey IQR (interquartile range) fences — Q1 − 1.5×IQR and Q3 + 1.5×IQR — computed per fuel type at materialisation time. Trend charts use a Hampel filter (rolling median ± 3×MAD) instead, which correctly handles trending data. Anomaly-flagged prices are also excluded. Outlier prices are never deleted; they are flagged (`price_is_outlier = true`) and visible on the Anomalies → Statistical Outliers page for full transparency.
- **Forecourt categories**: The API's `is_supermarket_service_station` flag is unreliable (flags BP, Texaco, Maxol as supermarkets). Instead, `brand_categories` maps canonical brands to forecourt types (Supermarket, Major Oil, Motorway Operator, Fuel Group, Convenience, Independent). Motorway flag always takes priority; unmapped brands default to Uncategorised.
- **Numbered migrations**: Schema changes go through `migrations/NNN_name.sql` files, tracked in `schema_migrations`. No external tools — `migrate.py` handles discovery, ordering, and idempotent application.
- **Postcodes.io enrichment**: Each unique postcode is looked up via the free [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io) bulk API. Results are cached in `postcode_lookups` and provide authoritative lat/lng (fixing ~85 stations with bad API coordinates), admin district, parliamentary constituency, rural/urban classification, LSOA and MSOA. Failed lookups are recorded (NULL coords + timestamp) so they aren't retried.
- **Coordinate correction**: Stations with coordinates outside the UK (lat 49–61, lon -9–2) are excluded from the map. Unrecognised postcodes are surfaced in the Data tab with a "Fix coords" button for manual correction (e.g. sign errors in the source data).

## Web UI

The project includes a web dashboard at http://localhost:8080 (started via Docker Compose).

**Tabs:**
- **Dashboard** — headline prices, regional chart, forecourt category chart, cheapest brands, rural/urban price comparison, most/least expensive local authorities
- **Map** — every station on a Leaflet map, colour-coded by price, with admin district and rural/urban classification in popups; CSV/JSON download (editor+)
- **Trends** — average price line chart with hourly granularity for ≤30 days and daily for longer ranges, filterable by region, country, and rural/urban classification; CSV/JSON download (editor+)
- **Search** — query builder with postcode, brand, city, price range, category, local authority, constituency, country, and rural/urban filters; CSV/JSON download (editor+); click station names to view individual price trends; "View trend for selected/all results" for aggregate trend charting
- **Anomalies** — anomaly-flagged price records and statistical outliers excluded from current-snapshot averages (with IQR bounds for transparency); price correction tool (editor+)
- **Data** — normalisation report, brand aliases, brand categories, station overrides, postcode issues (stations with unrecognised postcodes + coordinate fix tool), and materialised view refresh (editor+)
- **Logs** — scrape run history and price correction audit trail
- **Users** — Cognito user management (admin only)

**User roles:**

Three-tier role system via Cognito groups:

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Everything — user management, data mutations, exports, tier preview switcher |
| **Editor** | Data mutations (aliases, categories, overrides, corrections), exports, view refresh |
| **Read-only** | View dashboards, map, trends, search (capped at 200 results, 90-day history) — no exports or data changes |

**API documentation:** see the [API docs page](http://localhost:8080/docs/api) (served from the web UI) or [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

### GOV.UK Fuel Finder API

This project sources all UK fuel price data from the [GOV.UK Fuel Finder API](https://www.developer.fuel-finder.service.gov.uk/). The API provides live snapshot pricing at ~7,500 fuel stations across the UK. We are grateful for this public data source and our use follows the [GOV.UK Fuel Finder developer guidelines](https://www.developer.fuel-finder.service.gov.uk/dev-guideline), including rate limiting, efficient polling, and safeguards on data redistribution. For full details, see the [Scraper](web/static/about.html#the-scraper) and [API usage guidelines](web/static/about.html#api-usage-guidelines) sections on the About page.

### Postcodes.io

Postcode enrichment is provided via [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io), a free and open API for UK postcode data. This enrichment adds accurate coordinates (fixing ~85 stations with incorrect data), administrative geography, parliamentary constituency, rural/urban classification, and statistical areas to our database.

The postcodes.io service and source code are provided under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The underlying postcode data is used under the following licences:

- **Great Britain postcode data**: [OS OpenData licence](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/licensing/os-opendata-licence.pdf) (contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2026; Royal Mail data © Crown copyright and database right 2026)
- **Northern Ireland postcode data (BT prefix)**: [ONSPD licence](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences) (contains National Statistics data © Crown copyright and database right 2026; NRS data © Crown copyright and database right 2026)

### Methodology and compliance

The methodologies used in this project — anomaly detection rules, statistical outlier exclusion (Tukey IQR fences for snapshots, Hampel filter for trends), brand normalisation, forecourt categorisation, and regional mapping — are fully documented in the [About page](web/static/about.html) of the web application. All averages and statistics shown in the dashboard exclude anomalous and outlier prices, with full transparency: these excluded prices remain in the database and are visible for inspection on the Anomalies page.
